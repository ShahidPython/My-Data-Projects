## ⚙️ How It Works

1. GUI Setup
    - Uses `tkinter` with custom circular buttons created using `Pillow`
    - Fixed-size window (370×540) with dark mode as default
2. Calculation Engine
    - Uses `simpleeval` for safe expression evaluation
    - Handles percentages by converting them to division by 100
3. Visual Effects
    - Buttons brighten on hover and darken when clicked
    - History displays up to 5 previous calculations
4. Theme System
    - Toggle between light and dark modes with the theme button
