# ⚖️ BMI Calculator App (Python + Tkinter GUI)

A beginner-friendly, interactive **Body Mass Index (BMI)** calculator built using `tkinter`, `Pillow`, and custom image assets. This app allows users to **input height and weight**, calculates BMI in real-time using sliders, and visually adjusts a character image based on height.

## 📌 Features

- 📊 **BMI Calculation**: Automatically computes BMI from height (cm) and weight (kg).
- 🧍 **Animated Character Image**: Character position changes based on height selection.
- 🎨 **Custom-Styled UI**: Built with icons, themed backgrounds, and intuitive layout.
- 🎚️ **Sliders for Input**: Smooth sliders for height and weight selection.
- 📋 **Result Display**: Shows BMI value, health category, and helpful tips.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. GUI Setup
    - Uses `tkinter` to create a fixed-size layout with styled images and background.
2. Height & Weight Input
    - Sliders let the user select height and weight, which are synced with text input boxes.
3. BMI Calculation
    - The BMI is computed using the standard formula and shown with status text.
4. Animated Visual
    - The character image moves vertically based on height input, providing visual feedback.
