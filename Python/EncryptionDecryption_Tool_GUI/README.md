# 🔐 Encryption/Decryption Tool (Python + Tkinter GUI)

A secure message encryption and decryption application that uses base64 encoding. This tool provides a simple interface to protect your messages with password authentication.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔒 **Message Encryption**: Convert your text into base64 encoded format
- 🔓 **Message Decryption**: Decode base64 messages back to readable text
- 🔑 **Password Protection**: Uses a secret key (password: "1234") for security
- ♻️ **Reset Functionality**: Clear all inputs with one click
- 🖥️ **Clean GUI**: Simple and intuitive interface with color-coded operations

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Encryption Process
    - Enter your text in the input box
    - Provide the secret key (password: "1234")
    - Click "ENCRYPT" to convert your message to base64 format
    - The encrypted message appears in a new red-themed window
2. Decryption Process
    - Paste a base64 encoded message in the input box
    - Provide the secret key (password: "1234")
    - Click "DECRYPT" to convert it back to readable text
    - The decrypted message appears in a new green-themed window
3. Security Note
    - The app uses a fixed password "1234" (for demonstration)
    - In a production environment, you would implement proper password handling
