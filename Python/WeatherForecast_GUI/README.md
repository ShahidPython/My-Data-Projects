## ⚙️ How It Works

1. City Input
    - User enters a city name in the search field
    - Application geolocates the city using Nominatim
2. Data Fetching
    - Retrieves timezone information using TimezoneFinder
    - Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
    - Calculates local time using pytz
3. Display
    - Presents weather information in an organized layout
    - Shows temperature, wind speed (converted to km/h), humidity, pressure, and weather description
    - Displays current local time of the searched location

## 📦 Dependencies

- `geopy` - For city geolocation
- `timezonefinder` - For determining timezones from coordinates
- `pytz` - For timezone calculations
- `requests` - For API communication
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (built-in)

## 🔧 Configuration

The app uses OpenWeatherMap API with a default API key. For production use:
1. Get your own API key from OpenWeatherMap
2. Replace the API key in the code:
```python
api = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid=YOUR_API_KEY&units=metric"
```
