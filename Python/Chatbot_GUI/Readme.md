Technical Details 🔧
AI Backend

    Uses Microsoft DialoGPT-medium model

    Local processing (no API keys required)

    Fallback responses for reliability

    Context-aware conversation tracking

Data Management

    Stores conversation history (last 50 messages)

    Remembers user name and preferences

    Local processing only - no data sent to external servers

Customization

    Easy to extend response patterns in responses.py

    Customizable theme colors

    Modular design for adding new features

Troubleshooting 🔍
Common Issues

    Model loading errors

        Ensure stable internet connection for first-time model download

        Check available disk space (models can be several GB)

    GUI not opening

        Verify tkinter installation: python -m tkinter (should open a test window)

        On Linux, install tkinter: sudo apt-get install python3-tk

    Slow responses

        First-time model inference may be slow

        Ensure adequate system resources

        Consider using CPU-optimized models for low-resource systems

    Missing dependencies
    bash

# Reinstall all dependencies
pip install --upgrade transformers torch pillow pyfiglet requests

Performance Tips

    GUI mode uses more resources than CLI

    First run will download AI models (~500MB)

    Subsequent runs will be faster using cached models

Development 🛠️
Extending Functionality

Add new response patterns in responses.py:
python

# Add new pattern
if "your pattern" in text:
    return "Your custom response"

Adding New Features

    Modify get_responses() function in responses.py

    Update help text to include new commands

    Test both CLI and GUI interfaces
