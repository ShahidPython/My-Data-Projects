# 🎤 Voice Recorder App (Python + Tkinter GUI)

A simple yet functional voice recording application that allows you to **record audio for a specified duration** and save it as a WAV file. Built using `tkinter`, `sounddevice`, and `scipy`, this app provides a clean interface with a countdown timer and automatic saving of recordings.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. GUI Setup
    - Uses `tkinter` to create a 600x700 fixed-size window with dark theme
2. Audio Recording
    - Uses `sounddevice` to capture audio at 44.1kHz stereo quality
3. Timer System
    - Counts down the specified seconds while recording
    - Shows completion alert when time elapses
4. File Saving
    - Uses `scipy.io.wavfile.write` to save recording as WAV file
