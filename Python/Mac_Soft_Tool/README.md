## ⚙️ How It Works

1. System Monitoring
    - Uses `psutil` and `platform` modules to display real-time system information
    - Battery status updates every second
2. Hardware Control
    - `screen_brightness_control` for brightness adjustment
    - `pycaw` for system volume control
3. Weather App
    - Uses OpenWeatherMap API with geolocation
    - Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
4. Utilities
    - `pyautogui` for screenshot functionality
    - `webbrowser` integration for quick app launches
