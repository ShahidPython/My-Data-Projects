## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Tkinter GUI Setup
    - A fixed-size, responsive GUI window is initialized using Tkinter.
2. Asset Management
    - Background and button icons are loaded from an `assets/` folder using `PhotoImage`.
3. Recording Logic
    - Uses the `pyscreenrec` module to record the screen at a defined frame rate.
    - Output is saved in the `recordings/` folder with a custom filename.
4. Control Buttons
    - **Start**: Begins recording with the given filename.
    - **Pause/Resume**: Toggles the recording state.
    - **Stop**: Stops and finalizes the video file.
