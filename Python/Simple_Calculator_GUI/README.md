## 📌 Features

- ➕ **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- % **Percentage Calculations**: Handles both standalone percentages (50% → 0.5) and percentage of values (50%200 → 100)
- 🆑 **Clear Function**: Single button to reset calculations
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Dark theme with color-coded buttons
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Fixed size (570×600) optimized for calculator use

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Install Python 3.7 or higher**
2. **Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Input Handling
    - Click buttons to build your calculation
    - Operations are displayed in real-time
    - Supports chained operations (e.g., 5+5×2)
2. Special Functions
    - `C` button clears all inputs
    - `=` evaluates the expression
    - `%` handles percentage calculations in two ways:
       - Converts standalone percentages to decimals (50% → 0.5)
       - Calculates percentage of following number (50%200 → 100)
3. Error Handling
    - Catches invalid expressions and displays "Error"
    - Automatically resets after errors
