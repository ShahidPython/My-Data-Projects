## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Tkinter GUI Setup
Initializes a fixed-size GUI with custom background and labels.
2. Image Asset Loading
Loads GUI components (top image, main image, button) from the `assets/` folder.
3. Speedtest Logic
Uses the `speedtest-cli` module to perform internet speed tests.
Calculates and updates download, upload, and ping values on the screen.
4. Result Display
Automatically updates the corresponding labels in the interface.
