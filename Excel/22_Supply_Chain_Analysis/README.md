# Project 22 – Supply Chain Process Optimization

## 📋 Description
Built an Excel-based dashboard to analyze and optimize supply chain efficiency by evaluating supplier performance, inventory sufficiency, delivery timeliness, and cost structure. The goal was to support smarter logistics and purchasing decisions through data-driven insights.

## 🧠 Excel Features Used
- Pivot Tables for multi-sheet analysis
- Interactive Slicers (Supplier, Category, Item, Delivery Status)
- Combo and Clustered Charts
- Conditional Formatting
- Structured Dashboard Design with Custom UI Styling

## 📊 Data Sheets Used
- `Supplier_Data`: Supplier ratings, lead time, and location
- `Inventory_Data`: Stock and reorder levels with holding costs
- `Orders_Data`: Order tracking with delivery targets
- `Delivery_Data`: Delivery status and dates
- `Costs_Data`: Unit, transport, and storage costs

## 📈 Key Pivot Tables
- **Supplier Performance Analysis**: Avg. Lead Time & Quality Score per supplier
- **Inventory vs Reorder**: Compares Stock vs. Reorder levels
- **Cost Holding Summary**: Shows full cost breakdown per item
- **Delivery Status Analysis**: Early, On-Time, and Late delivery counts

## 📊 Visual Charts
- Supplier Ratings vs Lead Time (Clustered Column)
- Inventory Level vs Reorder Threshold (Combo Chart)
- Holding Cost by Category (Clustered Column)
- Delivery Performance (Pie or Bar Chart)

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Supplier Performance**:  
  - *Speedy Supplies* has the best performance (3-day lead time, 92 quality score)  
  - *Reliable Inc.* is the slowest (7-day lead time) — needs contract review  
- **Inventory Management**:  
  - All items above reorder levels  
  - *Widget A* and *Gadget Y* may be overstocked  
- **Delivery Insights**:  
  - 33% of deliveries are late, only 1/3 on time  
  - Poor delivery scheduling or logistics strategy suspected  
- **Cost Analysis**:  
  - *ITM001* has the highest logistics cost due to transport  
  - *ITM003* is most cost-efficient — prioritize in procurement  
  - Recommend bundling orders and optimizing shipping routes
